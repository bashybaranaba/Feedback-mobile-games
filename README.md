**Welcome to Feedback mobile games!**

Being visually impaired makes playing mobile games quite difficult.We are looking forward to work  with game developers,designers,game players and visually impaired persons to make casual mobile games more accessible and intriguing.

Although there are a number of games on the market that are accessible for the visually impaired, many of them load the player with too much information while others are  simplified versions of popular games.The aim is to make mobile games that are accessible for the visually impaired and truly intriguing and fun to play.
