# Feedback-mobile-games

**Welcome to Feedback mobile games!**

Being visually impaired makes playing mobile games quite difficult.We are looking forward to work  with game developers,designers,game players and impaired persons to make more accessible and intriguing casual mobile games.

Although there are a number of games on the market that are accessible, some of them load the player with too much information while others are  simplified versions of popular games.The aim is to make truly intriguing mobile games that are accessible not only for the visually impaired, but also to other impaired persons.
